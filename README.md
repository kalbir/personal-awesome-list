# Personal Awesome List

I constantly find myself looking for that one link to the great article on X that I read about that would be really helpful right now. Maybe a personal [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) would help.

## Product Management

- [The open product management mega list](https://github.com/tron1991/open-product-management)

- [The first principles of product management](https://blackboxofpm.com/the-first-principles-of-product-management-ea0e2f2a018c) &mdash; maximise impact to the mission and achieve everything through others. Long, good.

## Software engineering

### Conceptual

- [How facebook manages releasing loads of software all the time](https://t.co/4DNsiOFIZn)

### Practical

- [Guide to squashing git commits](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/git-interactive-rebase-squash-amend-rewriting-history)

- [Git magic](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/index.html) &mdash; a comprehensive and easy to understand guide to git. Epic.

- [The git pickaxe](http://www.philandstuff.com/2014/02/09/git-pickaxe.html) &mdash; has the amazing `git log -p -S thing` to search for when "thing" was added as well as a bunch of other tips.   

## Elixir

## Work

- [The rands test](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-rands-test/) &mdash; test for health of your organisation, sort of strategy equivalent to [the Joel test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/)

## People

- [Who I want to work for](https://medium.com/@keavy/who-i-want-to-work-for-b04ce972c202) &mdash; Great list of characteristics of someone you'd want to work for, by GitHub senior engineer @keavy.

- [How to socialize changes at work](https://chelseatroy.com/2018/02/25/how-to-socialize-big-changes-at-work-part-1-start-at-the-grassroots-level/) &mdash; this is pretty much exactly what I think about introducing change into teams. This part is about finding allies and how to introduce your idea. It's as if I wrote it.

- [Strategic thinking with blogs and stickers](https://gilest.org/blogging-stickers.html) &mdash; a wonderfully clear bit of explanation of how you can communicate and embed your strategy through seemingly low key tools.

## Tools

- [Flourish, a tool for visualising data](https://flourish.studio/) &mdash; would be fun to play with this.

- [Checklistomania](https://github.com/18F/checklistomania) &mdash; tool from 18F for managing shared checklists (like onboarding people)
